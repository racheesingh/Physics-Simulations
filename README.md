# Physics Simulations in Java
These simulations have been developed under the guidance of Dr. Gaurav Dar, [BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa Campus](http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/) as a part of a government backed initiative to bring educational resources online.

# Credits
We have made of use of the [Easy Java Simulation](www.um.es/fem/EjsWiki/) Environment to build these simulations. Moreover, we have taken inspiration from [Opensource Physics'](www.opensourcephysics.org/) treasure of open source physics simulations. 

# Applications
As of now, we have built a foucault's pendulum simulation. One of the best, already available simulation of Foucault's Pendulum (also developed using EJS) was [this](www.cleonis.nl/physics/phys256/foucault_pendulum_intro.php). This was an amazing simulation and we have built upon it to suit our needs. In addition to providing a 3-D close-up view of the pendulum, we allow the user to zoom in and observe the trajectory of the pendulum bob.

This is an ongoing project and we will continue to put up simulations as and when we develop them.

# How To
To run the jar file from this repository, do:

```bash
java -jar <filename.jar>
```
If you have Java installed on your machine, this should start the simulation. For those wishing to modify the simulation in EJS, there is the in-built option: "Open Model in EJS".
